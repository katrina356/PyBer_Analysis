# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

PyBer provides ride-sharing services in urban, rural and suburban neighborhoods.  We were provided data on these services from the period January 2019 thru April 2019.  We then sliced the data using variables such as city type, drivers, average fares and total fares.  Below we summarize our key findings and provide three recommendations for expanding our services.

## Key Findings

### Totals by City Type
Urban cities account for a majority of the total rides, drivers and fares followed by suburban and rural cities

   - The average fare by city and driver is higher in rural cities ($55.49) and suburban cities ($39.50) compared to urban cities ($16.57).

### Total Fares by Time and City Type
Between January 2019 and April 2019 Urban cities provided the most revenue for the PyBer.  The Peak times in all city types is the last week of February.  However, the week of March 10th has the highest total fares in the urban cities

## Recommendations
   - Additional data:  To provide solid recommendations regarding where to expand / contract business we need additional data.  In this analysis we assume that each call is being responded to and that supply is meeting demand.  Is there any data regarding demand, wait times, our competitors and total addressable market (TAM).
   - Pricing:  We should review our fares and determine if we are charging enough in urban cities.  Additional competitive information would help with this recommendation
   - Drivers:  We should dive into more analytics around the suburban and rural ride share business, is there more demand that could be met.  The higher price point per ride and driver may make this a more lucrative model to expand in.
